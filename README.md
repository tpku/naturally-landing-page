Visit the live verison [here](https://naturally-landingpage.vercel.app/).

Together as a team we had to create a landing page for the fictive brand "Naturally".
- Products, images and video by CGD
- Identity, content and design by DD
- Execution, development and design by WD

## Setup

1. Clone the repository <br />
`open with GitHub Desktop` <br />
or use terminal <br />
`gh repo clone tpku/naturally-landing-page`

2. Open up the directory.<br />
`navigate to your github folder and open the project in a editor`<br />
or use terminal, root folder <br />
`code .`

3. Project structure is found in the "code" directory.

4. Enjoy!

## Conclusion

A useful and educational assignment. The biggest challenges during this project was managing time, sorting team dynamics and communication, since no one in the group had any previous experience of this type. As developers, we learned the importance of deadlines, especially for the team doing the work before us.
